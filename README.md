## LangChain Chat - Next.js

### Quick Start ðŸš€

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Launch the development server by running `npm run dev`.

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to view the application.

Explore the [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) at [http://localhost:3000/api/chat](http://localhost:3000/api/chat). You can modify this endpoint in the `pages/api/chat.js` file.

Please note that files in the `pages/api` directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) rather than React pages, and are mapped to the `/api/*` path. Happy coding! ðŸš€
